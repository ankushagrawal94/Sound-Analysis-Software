This code is designed to be used with the Processing application. It utilizes
the Minim audio library. The functions utilized include the FFT analysis and the
BeatDetection classes.

This code reads input from my local micrphone and performs an FFT analysis using
the Minim library. It determines frequencies based on this input and the
presence of a beat. Once the heights have been determined, it draws the output
in a new window. The colors of the bars are a function of the loudness of its
corresponding frequency.

This code is free to use, modify, and edit. Enjoy!
