This code is designed to be used with the Processing application. It utilizes
the Minim audio library. The functions utilized include the FFT analysis and the
beat detection.

This code reads input from my local micrphone and performs an FFT analysis using
the Minim library. It determines frequencies based on this input and then
determines the loudness of each of these frequencies. This is used, along with
the beat, to change the height of the bars. Once the heights have been 
determined, it draws the output in a new window. The colors of the bars are a 
function of the loudness of its corresponding frequency.

This code is free to use, modify, and edit. Enjoy!
